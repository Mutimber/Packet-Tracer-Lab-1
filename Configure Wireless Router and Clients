#Configure Wireless Router and Clients 

## Objective
Part 1: Connect the Devices

Part 2: Configure the Wireless Router

Part 3: Configure IP Addressing and Test Connectivity

## Background / Scenario
Your friend, Natsumi, heard that you are studying networking. She asked you to come over and help her connect her new home to the cable TV network. You need to connect the correct cables to the correct devices, connect devices to a home wireless router, and configure the router to provide IP addresses to network clients. Natsumi also wants you to setup a wireless LAN for her home network, so you will configure that as well. You are confident that this will be an easy process and the network will be setup in no time!

### Skills Learned
- Networking Setup and Configuration: Configuring both wired and wireless network devices including routers, PCs, and cable modems to establish a functional network infrastructure.
- Device Connection and Cabling: Understanding and implementing proper cable connections, such as coaxial cables for internet and video services, and Ethernet cables for connecting devices to routers.
- Router Configuration via GUI: Accessing and configuring router settings using a graphical user interface (GUI) to set up IP addressing, DHCP server settings, and basic network parameters.
- Wireless LAN Configuration: Configuring a wireless LAN, including network name (SSID), security settings (WPA2 Personal), and passphrase setup for secure wireless connectivity.
- IP Addressing and DHCP Configuration: Configuring IP addressing for network devices, including DHCP server settings to automatically assign IP addresses to connected devices.
- Network Testing and Connectivity Verification: Testing connectivity between network devices and verifying internet connectivity through web browsing, ensuring proper configuration and functionality of the network.
- Troubleshooting and Problem Solving: Troubleshooting connectivity issues and resolving configuration errors to ensure all network devices can successfully connect to the internet and communicate with each other.
- Security Configuration: Configuring basic security measures such as changing default passwords, limiting the number of DHCP users, and enabling wireless security to protect the network from unauthorized access.
